(Sorry for more links :D)


### Starting a Breakout Group

Please keep in mind that any part of any project worked on at Code for Milwaukee must be focused on **improving civic services, delivery, and/or aspects of the Greater Milwaukee community** and **must be open-source**. These requirements only apply to Code for Milwaukee-sanctioned hack sessions.

To start a breakout group, please fill out the form located at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScz46nBIBJDfCJFdp4jtpb_89gRtPoFpvgQxyxlywpW9OXtOg/viewform. If you do this during the Hack Night and before the breakout group introductions, please let a member of the Core Team know so you can be recognized and allowed to make an introduction.
