#### Campaigning and Solicitation 

- No campaigning is allowed at CfM events. We are a non-partisan organization; please do not distribute flyers or other campaign materials.
- We do not allow most forms of recruiting on the behalf of for-profit organizations at our events, with the possible exceptions in the cases where the event is sponsored by, hosted by, or features a presentation from a for-profit organization. We are a non-profit organization focused on improving Milwaukee's public services via open source technologies, so we ask that no recruiting is done during CfM events.
- If you have any questions about the above, please contact CfM. If in doubt of whether your actions may not be permissible, please refrain from those actions, or please get pre-approval from the CfM Core Team.
- If you have concerns about an attendee who you think may be running afoul of these rules, please bring this to the attention of the CfM Core Team members.
