## Venue Information and Rules

Parking is not free on UWM campus grounds. There is a parking garage under UWM's Lubar Hall with a tunnel that connects to Bolton Hall. The fee to park is $2 an hour for the two hours, then $1 an hour following. Most attendees pay $5 or less for parking. Otherwise, free street parking is available in the surrounding neighborhoods within a short distance to UWM - please check street signs to avoid a ticket or tow. We are in room B87 on the Basement Floor of Bolton Hall.

## New to Code for Milwaukee

Please see [Brian Barkley of the Code for Milwaukee Core Team](https://codeformilwaukee.org/join-us) if you are new to our group for orientation information.

## We Need Your Help! Bi-Monthly Hack Events

**TRYING THIS AGAIN**

Code for Milwaukee currently hosts one Hack Night per month, and we are getting a lot of interest to expand into a second event every month. We are considering hosting a second monthly event, perhaps more informal than the Hack Nights.

When might be a good time to have a second monthly event? Please tell us by filling out the survey at: https://forms.gle/oRmDMkzywKDLJJz86

### Starting a Breakout Group

Please keep in mind that any part of any project worked on at Code for Milwaukee must be focused on **improving civic services, delivery, and/or aspects of the Greater Milwaukee community** and **must be open-source**. These requirements only apply to Code for Milwaukee-sanctioned hack sessions.

To start a breakout group, please fill out the form located at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScz46nBIBJDfCJFdp4jtpb_89gRtPoFpvgQxyxlywpW9OXtOg/viewform. If you do this during the Hack Night and before the breakout group introductions, please let a member of the Core Team know so you can be recognized and allowed to make an introduction.
